# ImpossibleGame3D

Project made in the Computer Vision course, in Universidade de Aveiro, 2017.

Online game using WebGL, where the user controls a cube and the main goal is not to hit the obstacles.
There are fixed obstacles and flying obstacles. The other goal is to collect the maximum yellow coins, and avoid the purple ones.
There are also acceleration zones, where the users' cube walks faster.
